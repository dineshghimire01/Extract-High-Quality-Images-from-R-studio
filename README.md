Very useful two extra lines of code to extract high quality and desired dimension of images/plots/figures.
- Tagged Image File Format(TIFF) better for poster presentations (very high quality graphics needed) and manuscripts. File size is heavier so depends upon you if its suitable for powerpoint presentations too.
- Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) better for powerpoint presentations and manuscripts.
